# LSTM for muscle activation prediction
Work at Institute for Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPVS) at the University of Stuttgart
The goal is to predict the activation of the 5 arm muscles given the angle, angular velocity, angular accelaration of the arm and the weight which will be holded.
# Motivation
The LSTM will be implemented in a Hololens application to visualize the muscle activation of an opposed person. It can than be used, for example, for the education of psychotherapists.
